Basic Calculator in Python ðŸ§®

This is a simple Python program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) based on their input.
How It Works

    The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
    The user selects an operator (+, -, *, /).
    The program performs the chosen mathematical operation.
    The result is displayed.

Example Usage

Input the first number: 10
Input the second number: 5
Input the operator (+, -, *, /): +
The result of 10.0 + 5.0 is: 15.0

Features

âœ… Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)
âœ… Handles division by zero with an error message
âœ… Uses float conversion for accurate calculations
How to Run

    Ensure you have Python installed (python --version to check).
    Clone the repository or download the script.
    Open a terminal in the project directory and run:

    python calculator.py

Future Improvements

    Add more operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).
    Implement a GUI version using Tkinter.
    Allow multiple operations in a single input.
